 * Some basic rules while coding in Programming Contests:
 * Try to follow at least 80% of them
	Correctness
		- final declaration for required data types
		- avoid Object creation 
		- Scanner slows down, use InputReader
		- avoid too many static functions	
	Efficiency
		- use library functions as much as possible		
		- assertEquals("RESULT", functionToCall())
	Debugging-ability
		- avoid too many global variables 
		- Separate logic from meta-processing
		- variable/function pneumonics must make sense
